You will not able to solve this, until you have your skin on. Arnie will confirm it.
Hint: if your flag looks good, but taskboard says "bad flag", try another encoding table. Flag is meaningful and l33t.`

One teammate pointed out that they were from the "Alien vs. Predator" alphabet where Arnold Schwarzenegger starred but the challenge already gave us a clue by mentioning "Arnie" and "not a terminator". There are a lot of versions online that weren't working and gave us the wrong string until we found this font https://fonts2u.com/predator.font and with lots of patience we got the the flag `kks{Y0uNgArni3IsCoOl}`
