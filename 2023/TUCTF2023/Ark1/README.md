## FLAG:
`TUCTF{baabaablacksheep}`

## Solution

the first thing I did was to use `file sheep` to figure out what I was up against. sheep is an ssh key, and my goal is to find a password tied to this key. I listened to the challenge suggestion, got from rockyou.txt all the words that have sheep as a substring with grep and then used john the ripper to crack the hash generated by ssh2john

```
ssh2john sheep > sheep_hash
cat rockyou.txt | grep sheep > sheep2
john -w=sheep2 sheep_hash
```
