## FLAG:
`TUCTF{K3eP_M4_Pa$s_rE4L_SaF3}`

## Solution

the first thing I did was to use `file woof` to figure out what I was up against. woof is an keepass database, and my goal is to find a password to open this database. I listened to the challenge suggestion, got from rockyou.txt all the words that have woof as a substring with grep and then used john the ripper to crack the hash generated by keepass2john

```
cat rockyou.txt | grep dog > woof2
keepass2john woof > woof_hash
john -w=woof2 woof_hash
```

after I opened the database with the official keepass reader downloaded from https://keepass.info/download.html I found that the flag was deleted and retrieved it by following the screenshot I put in the screen.
