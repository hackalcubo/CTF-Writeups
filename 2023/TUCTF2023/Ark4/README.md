## FLAG:
`TUCTF{B3w4R3_7h3_f1r3_4nd_7h3_f0x}`

## Solution

the first thing I did was to use `file fox` to figure out what I was up against. Is a zipped file that contains several files. They seem to belong to a specific type of program and by investigating the files better I understand that it is a firefox user folder. This folder can be added to firefox as a profile folder through the procedure shown in the figure. One has to visit the link visible in the address bar and set the browser profile with the folder. Once done one has to go to the password section and find the flag
